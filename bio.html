	  <p>Hello! My name is Andreanna Montaos and I am currently a sophmore at Waubonsee Community College. <p>

	  </p>
	
	Majoring at Computer Science, I plan to transfer to University of Illinois at Chicago in hopes to transfer in the 2025 fall semester. 
	My goal is to deepen my knowledge and gain hands-on experience through internships in web development and design, with an eye toward advancing into roles such as UX design/research,
	e-commerence web development, data analysis, digital project management, SEO/SEM specialization.
	<p>
	In addtion to my aspirations, I want to explore my curiosity about the world of semiconductors and the intricate processes that occur in a cleanroom!
	When I have free time, my favorite activities to do are playing the guitar and dancing in my local studio.
